            <h2>Some history first</h2>
            <p>In 2012 Save The Children came in contact with the only teacher at one of their mobile schools in Babile.
                The teacher shared the reasons behind the amount of children dropping out. Babile is a fairly dry region, which
                leads to a lot of the students not showing up to school, and instead collect water and take care of their
                families. In other instances girls down to the age of 14 get married before completing their education. Babile
                is a strip of land in Ethiopia, and in 2007 the country had a dropout rate of 60% in primary schools, and many
                other african countries struggle with the same issue.
                Save the children works towards helping children and securing their education. Every year the organization
                reports children who drop out from schools all around the world. They have most of the data, but lack a way to
                reach the right and influential people, who can help resolve this issue.
                That’s why our group will focus on african countries who struggle with issues like these. We will introduce an
                IT-system, or a platform that will collect and process every piece of data collected so it reaches the right
                people. We will introduce a combination of an existing system, and our system, that will make it more
                efficient.</p>

        <h3>Our solution</h3>
        <p>What we think would really be helpful in the fight against students dropping out would be to test out
            Better enrollment data trough HDX</p>

        <h3>What is HDX (Humanitarian Data Exchange)?</h3>
        <p>The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is an open platform for sharing humanitarian data.​We want to
            add geographical data to the attendance and enrollment data in developing countries. Combining this
            new data set with other geographical humanitarian data shared on the HDX (Humanitarian Data Exchange)
            will enable ​Save the Children​ to detect and understand underlying social and economic problems
            contributing to children dropping out.</p>

        <p>The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is an open platform for sharing humanitarian data. We want to add
            geographical data to the attendance and enrollment data in developing countries. Combining this new
            data set with other geographical humanitarian data shared on the HDX (Humanitarian Data Exchange) will
            enable ​Save the Children​ to detect and understand underlying social and economic problems
            contributing to children dropping out.
            An example of this would be to cross-reference data on food price and availability, with attendance
            data for students from a given region. This would make it possible to intervene earlier to ensure
            continued enrollment and attendance.
            The use of HDX-data will be facilitated by the HDX Python API, which makes it possible to both use and
            add data to the HDX-database.</p>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>We acknowledge that there are numerous risks involved in creating and distributing our project. For
            example the data can be inaccurate due to corrupt governments who tamper with the data. Furthermore
            the participation from teachers can be lacking if they are not obligated to use it. There is also
            concern to be raised around the pricing of the project, and the security of the data collected.</p>

    <div class="block">
        <h3>Financing</h3>
        <p>Financing: Several humanitarian organisations already exist that finance humanitarian projects, such as
            GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), UNICEF, Humanitarian Innovation Fund. Banks such as DNB and World Bank could
            also be interested in funding the project as it could be beneficial to them, in terms of good PR.
            Private investors and crowd-sourcing could also be a source of funding. Google and Microsoft could also
            be interested in sharing existing technology to analyse the data. The project could also be financed by
            cooperation between several humanitarian organisations and states.</p>
